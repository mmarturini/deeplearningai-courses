    "#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input\n",
    "- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, \"\"\", < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`\n",
    "#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output\n",
    "- JSON, HTML\n",
    "#### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied\n",
    "In the text you provide to the LLM ask to check whether certain conditions or assumptions are verified\n",
    "#### Tactic 4: \"Few-shot\" prompting\n",
    "In the prompt itslef give an example of a succesfull prompt and response that you want to obtain\n",
    "### **Principle 2: Give the model time to think**\n",
    "A too complex task may trigger the model to give the wrong answer. Giving the model time to \"think\" means breaking down the request\n",
    "#### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task\n",
    "Break down the steps into a bullet list or numbered one\n",
    "#### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion"
